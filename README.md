# ABOUT

This repo is a personal project that I've developed over the course of my solidity apprenticeship, integrating notions I've acquired along the way (chainlink, openzeppelin, ERC721, ERC20, etc...). 

You should therefore consider this project as a sandbox, even though the applications function normally and integrate business logic.  

 **web3-token-airdrop-maker** is based on Ciara  Nightingale (Cyfrin) tutorial on Airdrop. The initial concept is enriched with an additional functionnality. Instead of a unique merkle tree injected in the airdrop contract (for unique usage), another Builder contract will be in charge of managing the writing and creation of each merkle tree in the airdrop (which now will handle multiple sets of claims).


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Forge using the instructions found at [https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).
3. Run the following command to compile the contract:

```bash
cd blockchain
forge build
```

Launch the unit tests :
```bash
forge test
```
